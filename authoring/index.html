          <div class="content"><h2>What is in it for me as an author?</h2>
<p>This collective Twitter is a platform to share bioinformatics and computational biology experience, both in academia and industry.
Each week the account has new author, who each day writes about a topic or talks with the followers.
You decide yourself, how much to write, what to write about, in which style. For a week this Twitter becomes yours and nobody dictates any rules (except for Etiquette - see below). Everything below are only best practices, not rules.

You may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get new subs from your target audience</li>
<li>Pitch your ideas and get feedback from the broad audience</li>
<li>Validate your experience and get hints from the audience</li>
<li>Meet inspiring people and learn new ideas</li>
<li>Structure your ideas</li>
<li>Help someone to avoid your mistakes</li>
<li>Receive technical and general questions people might be too shy to ask</li>
<li>Compete with other authors</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a unique experience. This is not your personal Twitter - so do not feel restricted by the expectations from your "professional brand"!</p>
<h2>How to become an author?</h2>
<p>— DM <a href="https://twitter.com/siberianpython">@siberianpython</a>, if you want to be an author</p>
<h2>Should I have a plan for the week?</h2>
<p>— TL;DR: Yes. It is better to have plan than not.
You don't need the plan - a list of topic to write about and discuss is enough.
But planning positively improve both your and the readers' experience.</p>
<h2>How much time does it take?</h2>
<p>— Previous authors say, that it takes about 1 hour to get ready before the week, and about 1-2 hours every day during the week.
Writing takes most of the time and efforts, conversations usually take way less time.</p>
<h2>Will I be bothered to answer questions?</h2>
<p>— Yes, from time to time. But conversations are the most important part of the @compbiounderhood experience.
Also, replying is easier, than writing threads.
Do not feed trolls, obviously.</p>
<h2>Are there popular topics to discuss?</h2>
<p>— You should write something you are passionate about, even if it does not look like it fits.
The more passionate you are, the better threads become.
This said, here is an incomplete list of topics for inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your career track, which decision you have made and why, what worked and what didn't</li>
<li>Interesting cases (making and launching something, which problems has occurred, what have you learned)</li>
<li>Framework, method, technology you know very well</li>
<li>Lifehacks you have learned from practice</li>
<li>Personal growth and development - books, time management, leisure time hobbies</li>
<li>Your working place - processes and approaches, culture</li>
<li>Your working philosophy</li>
<li>Other topics you are passionate about</li>
</ul>
<h2>What if...</h2>
<h3>I have never used Twitter?</h3>
<p>Not a problem, a lot of authors have not either. There is nothing hard, I promise.</p>
<h3>I am boring and an imposter?</h3>
<p>Our goal is not to invite only the superstars. Everyone has experience to share - just tell about your day-to-day work.
Remember, that the followers are interested in any type of experience!</p>
<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<p>Be polite and professional. Respect your readers. Do not insult or humiliate anyone.
Controversial, sexist, racist, and other disrespectful jokes are not welcome.</p>
<p>DM <a href="https://twitter.com/siberianpython">@siberianpython</a> if you think there is a violation of rules.</p>
<h2>How to write?</h2>
<h3>Create threads</h3>
<p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/create-a-thread">Threads</a> make long texts easier to follow and share on Twitter.
Productive authors have on average 20-30 tweets a day. If they are on the same topic,
restructuring them as a thread obviously helps your followers to read.</p>
<h3>Interact with the followers</h3>
<p>The followers like to talk to you. You have the following tools to engage:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/liking-tweets-and-moments">Likes</a> - the least useful. You may like everything.</li>
<li><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/mentions-and-replies">Replies</a> - a tool for a dialog, a few followers will see them. Only the people who are following everyone in the discussion will see them.</li>
<li><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-retweet">Retweet</a> - a tool to share an important and interesting reply. Everyone will see them.</li>
<li><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-retweet">Retweet with comment</a> - like a reply, but everyone will see it. This tool is very useful, when you have an interesting conversation in replies. Feel free to use it often.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create a week plan and meta-thread</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the very beginning of the week post a weekly plan. This will help followers to prepare and understand what to expect.</li>
<li>At the last day consider creating a thread, where you will link all the most interesting threads and discussions.
When you will want to share your results, this will be a thread that is very easy to share.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Share on your social media</h3>
<p>Feel free to share that you are an author on your social media. Your friends will be very happy to read you!</p>
<h3>First day checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update the Twitters photo and bio to yours</li>
<li>Introduce yourself, post a week schedule, and pin this thread</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoid:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid direct advertisement - we will enforce this rule.
Feel free to share cases, stories, culture of your company.
But do not use this Twitter as a place for advertisement of your job offers, selling subscriptions, etc.</li>
<li>Avoid open questions - people engage poorly with them.
Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-polls">polls</a> instead.
If you really need an open answer - try to provoke your audience (but remember the Etiquette).</li>
<li>Avoid posting too few (for example "one post per day") - such weeks never become successful.</li>
